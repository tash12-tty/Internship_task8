## Objective : To understand the role of VPN in protecting privacy and security ##
VPN used : Opera VPN

## Procedure ##
Step-1 : Open the VPN server
Step-2 : Change the VPN's current server to any virtual server
Step-3 : Note down the IP address of the virtual location
Step-4 : Compare the virtual IP with your actual IP

## What is VPN ##
- Encrypts your internet data so that nobody in the middle can easily read it.
- Changes your visible IP address such that websites see the VPN server’s address, not your real one.
- Creates a secure connection even if you are on unsafe networks (like public Wi-Fi).

## Advantages of a VPN ##
1. Privacy protection : Your real IP and location are hidden. ISPs (internet providers) can’t easily track what websites you visit.

2. Data security : Your traffic is encrypted. Safe to use public Wi-Fi (hackers can’t easily steal your data).

3. Bypass restrictions : Access websites, apps, or content blocked in your country or region. Useful for streaming services, news sites, or censorship bypass.

4. Remote access : Companies use VPNs so employees can securely connect to office networks from anywhere.

5. Avoid tracking & profiling : Advertisers and trackers have a harder time building a profile of your online activity.

## Disadvantages of a VPN ##
1. Not total anonymity : VPN hides your IP, but websites can still track you with cookies, browser fingerprints, or account logins.

2. VPN provider trust : Your ISP can’t see your traffic, but the VPN company can. If the provider is untrustworthy, your privacy is at risk.

3. Speed reduction : Data goes through an extra server and encryption, so internet speed may drop.

4. Blocked by some services : Some websites/apps detect VPN traffic and block access (e.g., banking apps, Netflix regions).

5. Doesn’t protect from everything : VPN doesn’t stop viruses, phishing, or malware. It only protects the data “in transit.”
